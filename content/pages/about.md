Title: about

Hello, I'm Elliot. I am passionate about using technology to level the playing
field in health. I want highly traind clinicians to spend their time pushing the
boundaries and leaving the well understood things to computers. I think AI is
one of the many factors in this change and the one I can do the most to effect.

I am finishing a PhD in Elec/Biomed Engineering, focued on MRI.

I also like making bread and plenty of other random things. Hit me up any time
on twitter (@smitec).
