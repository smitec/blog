Hey, I'm Elliot, smitec in most places on the internet.

I have a degree in Electrical Engineering, and I'm currently a PhD candidate in biomedical engineering focused on MRI.

I founded a startup, [HSK Instruments](http://hskinstruments.com) working on medical technology.

Most of my time is spend writing code, typically python, javascript or Java (for android) with more Rust creeping in recently. 

If you are interested in my professional qualification (i.e you would like a resume) you can email me at [elliot@smitec.io](mailto:me@smitec.io)

I tweet at [@smitec](https://twitter.com/smitec) which is my preferred place for all things social media.
